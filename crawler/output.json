Write a post reponding to the professor's question.\n\nIn your response you should do the following:\n\nExpress and support your opinion\n\nMake a contribution to the dicussion in your own words.\n\nAn effective response will contain at least 100 words.\n\nDoctor Smith\n\nConsidering environmental protection issues, do you think imposing taxes and fines on polluting campanies is effective?\n\nAmy\n\nI don't think that method is necessarily effective. Some large or wealthy companies might choose to simply pay the finer rather than change their production methods or polluting behavior. They might find paying the fine more economical than altering their production processes.\n\nRory\n\nI have a different perspective. I believe that levying environmental taxes and fines on companies is effective. Firstly, taxes and fines can provide the government with funds that can be used for environmental protection projects or research into clean technologies. Secondly, even if some companies opt to pay the fines, many others will change their production methods to avoid these additional costs.\n\nModel Essay\n\nHonestly, the notion of taxing and fining polluting companies seems, at face value, a straightforward solution. However, I have reservations about its real-world effectiveness. Let's dive a bit deeper. For colossal corporations, especially those ranking in billions annually, fines, even if hefty, can be viewed as just another operating cost. They might crunch the numbers and find that it's more cost-effective to pay the fine rather than overhauling their operations. A glaring example is the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010. BP, despite being slapped with billions in fines, has seen its stock rebound and profitability return, while the Gulf of Mexico bears the lasting environmental scars. Also, consider how some corporations might leverage legal loopholes to minimize these fines or avoid them altogether. While these panalties might pinch smaller companies harder, the real environmental offenders -- the industrial behemonths -- might find it more convenient to just pay up and push forward.\n\ngpt4 polisher (made by the system prompt:You are a writing experts, provide authentic US english essays and help the user polish his writings, also you are helpful to tell him how to improve his writing.The usr is a non-native english learner preparing for his TOEFL exam, so you should first polish the essay he gives and then tell him the reasons of the changes.)\n\nPolished Essay:\n\nAdmittedly, the concept of imposing taxes and fines on polluting companies appears, at first glance, to be a clear-cut solution. Nevertheless, I harbor doubts regarding its efficacy in practice. Delving deeper, it becomes apparent that for massive corporations, particularly those with annual revenues in the billions, fines—even substantial ones—may simply be regarded as an additional business expense. They may calculate that it is more economical to absorb the fine than to revamp their operations. A stark illustration of this is the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. BP, despite being hit with multibillion-dollar fines, has witnessed its share prices recover and its profitability restored, while the Gulf of Mexico continues to suffer enduring environmental damage. Moreover, some companies might exploit legal loopholes to reduce or dodge these fines. Although such penalties may squeeze smaller businesses more severely, the true ecological culprits—the industrial giants—might deem it more expedient to settle the fines and proceed with business as usual.\n\nReasons for Changes:\n\n1. Clarity and Conciseness: The phrase \"Hoestly, the notion of taxing and fining\" was corrected to \"Admittedly, the concept of imposing taxes and fines\" for clarity and to correct the typo in \"honestly.\" The word \"concept\" is more precise than \"notion,\" and \"imposing\" is more direct than \"taxing and fining.\"\n\n2. Formality and Tone: The phrase \"Let's dive a bit deeper\" was removed to maintain a formal tone suitable for an academic essay. The essay should maintain a consistent level of formality throughout.\n\n3. Vocabulary and Precision: \"Colossal corporations\" was changed to \"massive corporations\" for a more academic tone. \"Ranking in billions annually\" was changed to \"with annual revenues in the billions\" for precision and formality.\n\n4. Grammar and Syntax: The phrase \"They might crunch the numbers\" was kept for its colloquial effectiveness, but the surrounding text was adjusted for grammatical correctness and flow. \"Overhauling their operations\" is more precise than \"revamping their operations.\"\n\n5. Consistency and Style: \"A glaring example\" was changed to \"A stark illustration\" to vary the language and maintain reader interest. \"Stark\" also conveys the severity of the example.\n\n6. Legal and Technical Accuracy: \"Leverage legal loopholes\" was changed to \"exploit legal loopholes\" for a more accurate description of the misuse of legal systems.\n\n7. Perspective and Focus: The phrase \"While these panalties might pinch smaller companies harder\" was corrected to \"Although such penalties may squeeze smaller businesses more severely\" to correct the typo in \"penalties\" and to use more formal language (\"squeeze\" instead of \"pinch\").\n\n8. Economic Terminology: \"The real environmental offenders -- the industrial behemonths -- might find it more convenient to just pay up and push forward\" was changed to \"the true ecological culprits—the industrial giants—might deem it more expedient to settle the fines and proceed with business as usual\" for precision and to use more formal economic terminology (\"culprits,\" \"giants,\" \"expedient\").\n\nBy making these changes, the essay becomes more formal, precise, and suitable for an academic context, which is essential for TOEFL writing tasks.\n\n选校！！！\n托福写作2023.11.11 不同...\n评论\n目录\nQuestion\nModel Essay\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

However, others have observed that differences between thenselves and people from other countries are growing. In your view, are differences between people from different countries increasing, or are they diminishing? Why?\n\nAmy\n\nI think the differences among us are decreasing as our exposure to products from other countries grow. We can enjoy food from any country. We can watch movies made in faraway places. We can go to a store and buy authentic goods from around the world. These things become part of our normal life and make our differences seem smaller.\n\nRory\n\nI understand what Amy is saying, but for many people, being exposed to differences make them retreat into their own corner even more. Look at social media. We are exposed to many different people and ideas, but a lot of people talk only to those they agree with and ignore the rest. This only makes the difference between people increase.\n\nModel Essay\n\nIn my perspective, the interconnectedness of the modern world has indeed led to a reduction in differences between people from differences countries. The global exchange of cultural elements, such as cuisine, movies, and authentic goods, has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. Take food, for instance - it's now commonplace for many people to savor dishes from various corners of the globe, breaking down culinary barriers. Additionally, the accessibility of international films and the availability of authentic products in local stores contribute to a shared cultural experience. These shared elements foster a sense of familiarity and understanding among diverse populations, ultimately diminishing the perceived differences that may exist between people of different nationalities. Moreover, the rise of multinational collaborations in business, science, and technology further underscores the convergence of global cultures. For instance, multinational companies often bring together teams from various countries to work on projects, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation.\n\n149 words\n\n范文分析\n\n总体思路：立场是说全球差异变小了，一是因为文化元素在全球流动，二是因为全球合作加强\n\n论点一：文化元素在全球流动\n\n用了很多例子，首句的such as是举例， food for instance又是举例，接下来的国际电影，商品也是举例，然后最后一句升华一下，有是文化、感知层面的升华句：foster a sense of familiarity... diminsh the perceived differences\n\n论文二:全球合作加强\n\n还是举例来扩充，首句要用such as来说明各个领域都有合作，然后这个合作凸显了全球文化的融合，很好的句式。下面又举跨国公司的例子收尾。\n\n托福学术写作2023.11.4公司...\n命令行ChatGPT工具推荐\n评论\n目录\nQuestion\nModel Essay\n范文分析\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

Having a well-structured to-do list every day can be very effective. It helps in organizing tasks and ensuring that everything is completely in a timely manner. This method provides a clear roadmap for the day and enhances producitivity.\n\nRory\n\nI disagree. Every day brings about many different and insteresting things. Rigidly sticking to a to-do list might hinder spontaneity and the ability to embrace unforeseen opportunities. Life's unpredicitablity can make it challenging to adhere strictly to a predetermined plan.\n\nModel Essay\n\nUndoubtedly, utilizing well-structured to-do lists is an exemplary strategy for effective time management. As a proponent of this method, I find that meticulously planning daily tasks not only enhances organizational efficiency but also provides a concrete roadmap for accomplishing goals. It's akin to orchestrating the symphony of one's day, ensuring that each note harmonizes seamlessly with the next. Personally, dxuring weekends, I adhere to a pre-arranged to-do list.

Write a post responding to the professor's question.\n\nIn your response you should do the following.\n\nexpress and support your opinion.\n\nmae a contribution to the discussion in your own words.\n\nA effective response will contain at least 100 words.\n\nDoctor Smith\n\nWe've been discussing the idea that human well-being is not necessarily improved by ever-increasing ever-increasing production and consumption of goods and services. Some people argue that humans already consume too many goods, from clothing to electronics to food; They believe that excessive consumption has created serious problems for humanity and even the planet. Do you agree that excessive consumption - buying more than we truly need - has become a serious problem? Why or why not?\n\nAmy\n\nI absolutely agree. We buy far more than we need, and that can't continue indefinitely. For years people have used shopping as a form of recreation. The products bought on a whim are gilling up landfills, and the energy expended producing the goods has created a global warming crisis. We should start gradually reducing consumption.\n\nRory\n\nI disagree with the idea that over-consumption is a dramatic problem. I agree there is some over-consumption, but it happens mostly with wealthy people. I think in general almost everyone else already buys only what they need. In fact, many people around the world are not even able to obtain everything they need.\n\nModel answer\n\nI share with the viewpoint that excessive consumption has indeed become a pressing issue. The modern culture of consumerism encourages people to buy more than they truly need, contributing to environmental degradation and resource depletion. The fast fashion industry, for instance, promotes the disposability of clothing, leading to immense waste. Moreover, the overconsumption of electronic gadgets results in e-waste, posing environmental hazards. It;s crucial to recognize the impact of our consumption patterns on the planet and shift towards a more sustainable and mindful approach. Gradually reducing our consumption and adopting practices like recycling can contribute to mitigating the adverse effects of overconsumption. For instance, embracing the concept of a circular economy, where products are designed for longevity and recyclability, could be a viable solution to tackle this issue.\n\n127 words\n\n命令行ChatGPT工具推荐\n独立口语两篇：TOP75与73\n评论\n目录\nquestion\nModel answer\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

Your response will be judged on the basis of the quality of your writing and on how well your response presents the points in the lecture and their relationship to the reading passage. Typically, an effective response will be 150 to 225 words.\n\nReading Part\n\nAsteroids are large space objects made of rock and ice. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in our solar system.Though we often hear ideas about establishing colonies of humans to live and work on our Moon or our neighboring planet, Mars, some think that sending people to an asteroid would actually be the best colonization option for a number of reasons.\n\nLow Gravity\n\nTo begin with, asteroids are often much smaller than planets, so they have lower gravity. When landing a spaceship, the craft would not be pulled as strongly or as forcefully toward the asteroid's surface, making the landing safer than landing on the Moon or Mars; it would also allow a spacecraft to carry much more equipment needed to set up the colony. It would also be easier for the spacecraft to take off again, so the spaceship would need to carry considerably less fuel for the trip back to Earth.\n\nMining Valuable Metals\n\nNext some asteroids are rich in valuable elements and precious metals that are relatively rare on Earth, such as gold and platinum. An asteroid colony would be extremely profitable and a good source of these raw materials. The colonists or businesses sponsoring them could more than pay for the cost of their support by mining minerals and sending them back to Earth.\n\nEasy to Reach\n\nFinally, asteroids are a good option for colonization because some of them would be very easy to reach. There are a number of asteroids that periodically come within or near Earth's orbit Some of them actually get closer to Earth than our Moon. So these asteroids would be much easier and more affordable to get to and get back from than a planet like Mars, which would require a two-year trip in each direction.\n\nListening Part\n\nDirections:Now listen to a part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.\n\nAsteroid colonization is not a very practical idea. Each of the points in the reading has a serious downside.\n\nFirst, while low gravity on an asteroid would make landing and taking off relatively easy, low-gravity environments also present certain risks. In a low-gravity environment, people start losing muscle mass and their bone density becomes lower. Even astronauts who spend just a few months in spaceships, which are low-gravity environments, suffer from health problems like muscle and bone density loss. Imagine the health problems that long-term colonists would experience on asteroids.\n\nSecond, the availability of valuable metals might make an asteroid colony seem like a profitable idea but that’s not the whole picture. You have to consider additional factors. One thing is the costs. The costs of supporting a colony and of transporting the metals are likely to be high and will reduce the profits. And furthermore, there’s no guarantee that the price for which you can sell the metals will remain the same. If precious metals are mined in large quantities, it would increase the supply of the metals, which could end up lower in the market price. So mining on asteroids may not be very profitable.\n\nThird, even if some asteroids are easy to reach, they may not be easy to return from. Asteroid orbits, the path on which asteroids travel through space, can be unusual. Some orbital paths come close to earth but then move away from earth, often a great distance away from earth. So even if an asteroid gets close to earth at one point, making it easy for colonists to get to the asteroid, it does not stay close to earth. It can actually travel much farther away from earth than a planet like Mars. Getting back from an asteroid that travels that far would be a challenge.\n\n参考笔记\n\nQuestion\n\nSummarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they challenge the specific points made in the reading passage.\n\nModel Essay\n\nThe reading passage is talking about sending people to an asteroid as the optimal colonization option and gives three reasons while the listening passage claims it to be unpractical.\n\nFirstly, the author proposes that asteroids have lower gravity and thus landing and taking off would be safer. However, the speaker claims that in low gravity environment, the muscle mass and bone density would be lower, which may cause health issues. Therefore, since colonists need to spend long time on the asteroid, their health would be affected severely.\n\nSecondly, the author maintains that mining valuable metals on asteroids would be quite profitable. However, the speaker argues that even though there are valuable metals on asteroids, transportation fees are very expensive, which will reduce the profits. What is more, when large amount of valuable metals is transported back to earth, their price would decrease accordingly due to the large quantities. Therefore, mining and transporting precious metals are not that profitable as they thought.\n\nThirdly, although the reading passage holds that some asteroids are easy to reach as they orbit near Earth periodically, the speaker fights against that. The speaker further claims that it might be easy to reach some asteroids but might be difficult to return from them. Asteroids do not stay near earth’s orbit permanently, instead, they will travel away from earth very soon after they come close. Therefore, colonists will find it challenging to get back to earth.\n\n238 words\n\n今天ChatGPT挂了，emmm，拿API润色一下吧：\n\ngpt-3.5-turbo-1106版本\n\nThe reading passage discusses the concept of colonizing asteroids as the most viable option for human settlement and provides three reasons to support this idea. However, the listening passage counters these arguments by highlighting the impracticalities of such a proposal.\n\nFirstly, the author of the reading passage suggests that asteroids, with their lower gravity, would make landing and takeoff safer. This is refuted by the speaker, who emphasizes the potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to low-gravity environments, such as decreased muscle mass and bone density. These health concerns could significantly impact the well-being of colonists over time, rendering the idea of colonization on asteroids less feasible.\n\nSecondly, the reading passage asserts that mining valuable metals on asteroids would be highly profitable. Conversely, the speaker argues that while valuable metals do exist on asteroids, the exorbitant transportation costs would greatly diminish any potential profits. Moreover, the influx of these metals back to Earth would lead to a reduction in their market value due to oversupply. As a result, the overall profitability of mining and transporting precious metals from asteroids is not as promising as initially suggested.\n\nLastly, the reading passage contends that certain asteroids are easily accessible due to their periodic orbit near Earth. However, the speaker challenges this point by highlighting the difficulty in returning from these asteroids once reached. As the speaker explains, asteroids do not remain in close proximity to Earth permanently, but rather move away after a brief period. This poses a significant challenge for colonists attempting to return to Earth, thereby undermining the practicality of establishing viable settlements on asteroids.\n\nOverall, the listening passage effectively undermines the claims made in the reading passage regarding the feasibility of colonizing asteroids, pointing out numerous practical challenges and potential drawbacks that need to be considered.\n\n298 words\n\ngpt-4-1106-preview版本\n\nThe reading passage discusses the possibility of colonizing asteroids as a superior option and outlines three key advantages. In contrast, the listening passage challenges this notion, deeming it impractical.\n\nFirstly, the author of the text argues that reduced gravity on asteroids facilitates safer landings and takeoffs, potentially minimizing risks associated with space travel. However, the speaker counters this with concerns about the detrimental effects of prolonged exposure to low-gravity environments, which can lead to significant muscle and bone mass deterioration. Consequently, the health of colonists committing to extended stays on an asteroid could be compromised severely.\n\nSecondly, the text posits that the exploitation of valuable metals found on asteroids could yield substantial economic benefits. Despite this, the lecturer disputes the viability of such a venture, highlighting the exorbitant costs of transportation that could erode potential profits. Additionally, he delineates potential market saturation that could ensue upon the return of these metals to Earth, leading to a decline in their value. As such, the notion of profiting from mining and transporting these materials may not be as lucrative as initially perceived.\n\nLastly, the reading passage comments on the proximity of certain asteroids that periodically orbit near Earth, suggesting an ease of accessibility. However, the lecturer rebuts this claim, stating that while reaching these celestial bodies might be feasible, the return journey may pose a significant challenge. Asteroids do not maintain a constant presence near Earth's orbit but rather drift away relatively swiftly after their close approach. This dynamic nature would create logistical difficulties for colonists attempting to navigate their way back to Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, it's clear that while the idea of asteroid colonization presents exciting prospects, the arguments made in the reading passage are systematically challenged by the listening passage, highlighting significant practical constraints that need to be addressed.\n\n299 words\n\nAPI调用格式\n\nimport os\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom constants import OPENAI_KEY\n\nSYSTEM_MESSAGE = \"You are a helpful rebot and you can follow the user's instruction to do a lot of things, like polishing a article.\"\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = OPENAI_KEY\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n###################\n\narticle_string = \"<replace with the article to revise>\"\n###################\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4-1106-preview\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"下面是一篇托福综合写作的回答，我希望你帮我美化一下，能够提升在托福考试中的分数，让我更好备考：{article_string}\"},\n  ],\n)\n\nprint(response)\n\n封面图，来自SDXL，prompt使用magic-prompt加工，原始prompt为“优美的，神秘的，Asteroids are large space objects made of rock and ice.

Your response will be judged on the basis of the quality of your writing and on how well your response presents the points in the lecture and their relationship to the reading passage. Typically, an effective response will be 150 to 225 words.\n\nReading Part\n\nMany countries require cigarette smokers to pay particularly high taxes on their purchases of cigarettes; similar taxes are being considered for unhealthy foods. The policy of imposing high taxes on cigarettes and other unhealthy products has a number of social benefits.\n\nFirst of all, the taxes discourage people from indulging in unhealthy behaviors. Raising taxes on cigarettes, for instance, leads people to buy fewer of them. Smoking has declined as taxes on tobacco have risen, showing that these taxes do work to make society healthier. It can be expected that imposing similar taxes on unhealthy food and beverages would help reduce obesity rates.\n\nSecond, taxes of this kind are financially fair. When people get sick as a result of their smoking or eating unhealthy foods, they create medical costs. It is unfair that everyone in the society, including nonsmokers and people who follow a healthy diet, should contribute equally to covering these costs. Taxing people who engage in unhealthy behaviors creates extra income that can be used to cover the medical costs. In this way, some of the financial burden is shifted from all of society to just those who choose to participate in the unhealthy activities.\n\nFinally, the high rate of taxation on cigarettes significantly increases revenue for the government. In addition to using this tax revenue on medical assistance, governments often use the revenue for other projects that benefit public welfare, such as building stadiums or creating public parks. Even basic government-supported services like public education benefit from these taxes. Thus, the taxes on cigarettes, and the proposed taxes on unhealthy foods, benefit everyone.\n\nListening Part\n\nDirections: Now listen to a part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.\n\nEach of the arguments about the benefits of cigarette and other such taxes can be challenged.\n\nFirst, these taxes don’t necessarily lead to healthier behavior. For instance, high cigarette taxes have led some smokers to buy cheaper lower quality cigarettes. Such cigarettes typically contain even more harmful substances than better quality cigarettes and present even greater health risks. Similarly, imagine how some consumers might react to higher taxes on unhealthy foods. They might continue buying the unhealthy foods they prefer even if they’re more expensive. And as a result, have less money left to spend on healthy foods. That certainly wouldn’t benefit their health.\n\nSecond, there are different ways of thinking about fairness. It might seem fair for people indulging in unhealthy behaviors to pay for the consequences of those behaviors through high taxes. But some people would argue that these taxes are unfair, because they don’t take into account people’s incomes. If a high-earning person and a lower-earning person are addicted to cigarettes and each smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. Paying the tax would be a greater expense for the low earner relative to his or her income. The same argument applies to the food taxes. So many people believe that these taxes are not fair because they create a much greater burden for those with smaller incomes than for those with higher incomes.\n\nFinally, the fact that governments can use this tax revenue for various projects has the downside. This income represents millions and millions of dollars and governments become dependent on it and don’t want to lose it. In consequence, the governments might not be forceful enough pursuing policies and implementing laws that might eliminate unhealthy habits altogether. For example, they are unlikely to adopt radical measure such as not allowing smoking in outdoor public areas such as parks or even banning smoking in all outdoor areas, public or private, because they don’t want to lose this income.\n\n参考笔记\n\nQuestion\n\nSummarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they challenge the specific points made in the reading passage.\n\nModel Essay\n\n某托福小课范文\n\nThe reading passage supports imposing high taxes on unhealthy food and cites several benifits, while the listening passage challenged all the benefits the author cited.\n\nFirst, the reading passage argues that high taxes would discourage people from buying unhealthy food, while the speaker refutes that raising taxes may cause more health risks. For example, people who smoke will buy more cheaper cigarettes instead, which contain more harmful substances would do more harm to their health. What is more, some people may insist on buying unhealthy food. As a result, they would have less money on healthy food.\n\nSecond, the author holds that the policy of raising taxes of unhealthy food is financially fair for the society whereas the listening passage fights aganist that by claiming that this policy creates burden to lower-income levels who are addicted to smoking or consuming unhealthy food, they should pay the same taxes. This would not be as financially fair as the reading claimed.\n\nThird, higher taxes would bring higher tax revenue for the government,, and the government can make good use of it on public welfare. However, the speaker cites the downside that a huge amount of tax income would make the government dependent on it and fell reluctant to implement policies and laws to eliminate the consumption of unhealthy food. For example, forbidding smoking in public areas would become hard to enforce for the government.\n\n232 words\n\n这个范文词汇有点过于简单，来参考一下GPT-3.5美化后的效果：\n\nThe provided reading passage fervently advocates for the imposition of elevated taxes on unhealthy food items, enumerating various advantages, while the listening passage critically contests each of these purported benefits.\n\nFirst and foremost, the reading passage contends that augmenting taxes would deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food, a point vigorously contradicted by the speaker. The speaker posits that escalating taxes may inadvertently exacerbate health risks. For instance, individuals who indulge in smoking may resort to acquiring cheaper, lower-quality cigarettes, thereby exposing themselves to even more pernicious substances, culminating in graver health consequences. Moreover, there is the plausible scenario where some consumers steadfastly cling to their preference for unhealthy food. Consequently, this tax hike would leave them with diminished financial resources to allocate towards wholesome dietary choices.\n\nSecondly, the author posits that this taxation policy embodies financial equity for society. However, the listening passage vehemently disputes this perspective, asserting that it places an inequitable burden on lower-income individuals who are ensnared in the grip of smoking or the consumption of unhealthy food. The contention is that regardless of income level, individuals addicted to these behaviors are obligated to pay identical taxes, thus rendering this fiscal approach less financially equitable than the reading purports.\n\nLastly, the reading passage underscores that heightened taxes would result in a substantial windfall for the government, to be judiciously employed for the betterment of public welfare. The speaker, however, contends that there is a downside to this fiscal dependency. The colossal influx of tax revenue could potentially lead to a governmental reliance that hampers the enactment of robust policies and laws aimed at curtailing the consumption of unhealthy food. For instance, stringent prohibitions on smoking in public areas may become challenging to enforce due to the government's reluctance to forgo the significant income generated from these taxes.\n\n300 words\n\ngpt-4-1106-preview api版本\n\nThe article strongly advocates the imposition of higher taxes on unhealthy foods, highlighting a number of benefits from such a policy. In contrast, the lecture casts doubt on each of the benefits mentioned by the reading, presenting a counterargument to the claims made.\n\nTo begin with, the reading suggests that elevated taxation on unhealthy food items would serve as a deterrent, discouraging consumers from making such purchases. On the other hand, the speaker contends that higher taxes might inadvertently lead to greater health risks. For instance, consumers of tobacco might opt for less expensive, more harmful cigarette brands as a result of raised taxes, further endangering their health. Furthermore, there is the possibility that some individuals will persist in their unhealthy food choices despite increased costs, thereby reducing their financial capacity to afford healthier alternatives.\n\nAdditionally, the author puts forth the notion that taxing unhealthy foods more heavily is a socially equitable financial approach. This view is contested by the lecture, which argues that such a policy disproportionately burdens lower-income groups who may be more likely to smoke or consume unhealthy food, as they would incur the same level of taxation. This stands in contrast to the initial claim of financial fairness.\n\nLastly, the article posits that higher taxes on such foods would generate increased revenue for the government, which could then be allocated towards public welfare initiatives. However, it is pointed out by the lecturer that substantial tax income could foster a dependency within the government, making it less inclined to pursue measures aimed at reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods. The lecture cites the potential difficulty in enforcing regulations like smoking bans in public places, given the government's reliance on the revenue generated by taxes on such activities.\n\nBy presenting a nuanced examination of the proposed tax policy's implications, the speaker effectively challenges the reading's assertions, thereby provoking a deeper consideration of the issue at hand.\n\n318 words\n\n对比一下小站托福的答辩范文，400多词怎么用？\n\nIn the reading passage, the author lists three reasons to prove there are many social benefits of imposing high taxes upon cigarettes as well as other unhealthy products. However, the professor in the listening contends that each of the arguments about the benefits of the cigarette and other such taxes can be challenged.\n\nFirstly, the reading passage claims that high taxes could prevent people from unhealthy behaviors, but the professor argues that these taxes don't necessarily lead to healthy behaviors. For instance, heavy taxes can lead some smokers to buy cheaper and lower quality cigarettes. Such cigarettes typically contain even more harmful substances than better quality cigarettes, and present even greater health risks. Similarly, imagine how some consumers might react to same taxes on unhealthy foods. They might continue buying the unhealthy foods they prefer even if it's more expensive, and as a result, have less money left to spend on healthy foods. That certainly wouldn't benefit their health.\n\nSecondly, in the reading passage, it is said that this kind of taxes are financially fair. On the contrary, the professor hold the opinion that there are different ways of thinking about fairness. It might seem fair for people indulging in unhealthy behaviors to pay for the consequences of those behaviors through high taxes, but some people would argue that these taxes are unfair, because they don't take into account people's incomes. If a higher earning person and a lower earning person are addicted to cigarettes, and each smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, paying the tax would be a greater expense for the lower earner relative to his or her income. The same argument applies to the food taxes, so many people believe these taxes are not fair, because they create a much greater burden for those with lower incomes than for those with higher incomes.\n\nFinally, according to the reading passage, such kind of high taxation could increase revenue for the government, while the professor maintains that the fact governments can use these tax revenues for various projects has a downside. This income represents millions and millions of dollars, and governments become dependent on it and don't want to lose it. In consequence, the governments might not be forceful enough pursuing policies and implementing laws that might eliminate unhealthy habits all together. For example, they are unlikely to adopt radical measures such as not allowing smoking in outdoor public areas such as parks, or even banning smoking in all outdoor areas public or private, because they don't want to lose this income.\n\n424 words\n\n封面图，来自SDXL：原始prompt为：悲伤的，愤怒的，Many countries require cigarette smokers to pay particularly high taxes on their purchases of cigarettes（后面经过了自动的翻译和增加）\n\n摸鱼网站\n托福综合写作TPO54\n评论\n目录\nTPO53\nReading Part\nListening Part\nQuestion\nModel Essay\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

Your response will be judged on the basis of the quality of your writing and on how well your response presents the points in the lecture and their relationship to the reading passage. Typically, an effective response will be 150 to 225 words.\n\nReading Part\n\nThe Salton Sea in California is actually a salty inland lake. The level of salt in the lake's water --- what scientists call its salinity --- has been increasing steadily for years by rainfall or rivers. If the trend continues, the lake's water will soon become so salty that the lake will be unable to support fish and bird populations. The lake would then become essentially a dead zone. Fortunately, there are several ways to reverse the trend that is threatening the lake's health.\n\nOne option is direct removal of salt from the lake's water in special desalination facilities. Water from the lake would be pumped into the facilities and heated. This would cause the water to evaporate into steam, while salt and other materials dissolved in the water would be left behind. The steam would then be cooled down and returned to the lake as salt-free water. Gradually, the high salt levels would be reduced and the lake's overall health would be restored.\n\nAnother possible solution is to dilute the salt level in the lake with water from the ocean. Since water in the Pacific Ocean is 20 percent less salty than the water in the lake, bringing ocean water into the lake would decrease the lake's salinity. The ocean water could be delivered through pipelines or canels.\n\nYet another solution would be to control the lake's salinity by constructing walls to divide the lake into several sections. In the smaller sections, salinity would be allowed to increase. However, in the main and largerst section, salinity would be reduced and controlled by, among other things, directing all the freshwater from small rivers in the area to flow into that main section of the lake.\n\nListening Part\n\nDirections: Now listen to a part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.\n\nIt would be great if we could stop the lake salt level from increasing and save its fish and bird populations. But the solutions you read about aren't realistic or practical.\n\nFirst, sure, taking salt out of lake by desalination would reduce salinity, but it would present serious problems as well. For example, as you've read, water pumped into desalination facilities evaporated and leaves behind solid materials that would dissolve in the water. Well, the solid materials that desalination facilities leave behind would pose a health risk. The materials will be mostly salt, but they would also include other types of chemicals. Some of the chemicals would be toxic, like selenum. If the wind spread selenium and other chemicals into the air and people breathe them in, that would be very dangerous to people's health.\n\nSecond, the idea of bringing ocean water into the lake, again, this would be reduce salinity. But as you've read, it would require constructing pipelines or canals. The problem is that the local government may not have enough resources to pay for such major constructions. The nearest shoreline of the Pacific Ocean is 100 kilometers away. Pipelines and canals are very expensive to build over such long distances.\n\nAs for the third solution, dividing the lake into sections by building a system of walls. Well, that's unlikely to work for very long. That's because the Salton Seas is located in a region that experiences frequent and sometimes intense geological activity, like earthquakes. That activity would almost certainly destory the walss separating the different sections. So while this solution might work for a short while, the walls would likely collapse the first time there is a major earthquake. And water from the special sections with high salinity would mix back in with the low-salinity from the main section.\n\nQuestion\n\nSummarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they respond to the specific concerns presented in the reading passage.\n\nModel Essay\n\nThe Salton Sea in California is facing a problem that the salinity has been increasing for the rapid evaporation rate. The reading passage has given three solutions while the listening part reveals the leak of them one by one.\n\nThe first option is to remove the salt directly from the lake's water by a special desalination facility. However, the professor argues that this method is very likely to cause health problems. As the water in the desalination facilities evaporates, solid materials would be left behind, which contain toxic chemicals, such as seleniums. Then, seperating would allow these chemicals to be spread by wind, which may pose a threat to people's health.\n\nThe second solution is bringing ocean water to the lake to dilute the salt level. The professor finds faults with this method by saying that this solution would be quiteunrealisticin consideration that the government may not have enough money to build any pipelines or canals. Moreover, the nearest shoreline is 100 kilemeters away, so the constrcution may cost a lot of money.\n\nThe last way is to divide the lake into several sections by building walls. The salinity in smaller sections would increase while in largest sections, by directing fresh water from small rivers, the salinity would be controlled. However, the professor refutes that this measure is just provisional, since the Salton Seas is located in place where the geological activities are frequent and intense. Water from the smaller sections may mix back in the main section so this solution will also fail very soon.\n\n258 words\n\n范文分析\n\n这个范文和我自己写的格式还是有一些区别的，可能是我拿低分的原因。\n\n首先是总起的一段，写的比较清晰简单，这样应该能显得文章思路清晰。\n\n然后接下来三个分段，他的写法是用the first option, the second solution, the last way这样来说，而不是我一直使用的First, the author contends that..., Second, the writer suggests that... Third, 然后词穷了，而且我这种写法在字数上比较冗余，缺少对文章意思的凝练。范文中承接下文的那句话“The reading passage has given three solutions while ...”可以和下文的option, solution和way对上，这种方式让读者读起来更加清晰。\n\n进一步分析二三四段落中每段的结构，可以发现他是有着重点的，并没有把阅读材料的内容全部涉及，二三段只有第一句是在讲阅读材料中的内容，第二句立马就However要讲听力材料了，除了第四段他阅读材料说的多了几句，但还是保持了听力材料占多数比例。\n\n转折句和我的写法大差不差，但是他有用一个形容词来凝练一整个反驳段的思路，unrealistic和provisional都是听力材料中没有出现的，是作者直接概括出来的，这说明要积累一些带有反驳意味的词汇。\n\n背景音推荐(《16bits的感动》，就是女主有点吵)：\n\nhttps://www.yhdmz.org/vp/23323-3-0.html\n\n托福综合写作TPO53\n被Baseten收费方式震惊\n评论\n目录\nTPO54\nReading Part\nListening Part\nQuestion\nModel Essay\n范文分析\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

Known for their furry claws and creamy roe, they are often steamed and served with vinegar, ginger, or other complementary condiments to enhance their rich flavor. The crab in the bowl appears to be opened up for consumption, revealing its inner contents, which includes creamy roe (the yellow substance), often considered a prized part of the dish. The bowl it's placed in features a traditional Chinese blue and white porcelain design.\n\n翻译过来：\n\n这张图片展示的是大闸蟹，这在世界某些地区是一种美味，尤其是在收获这些螃蟹的季节，在上海和江苏省。它们以毛茸茸的爪子和奶油般的鱼子而闻名，经常被蒸熟，配以醋、姜或其他补充调味品，以增强其浓郁的风味。碗里的螃蟹似乎是打开食用的，露出了里面的东西，其中包括奶油鱼子（黄色物质），通常被认为是这道菜的珍贵组成部分。它放置的碗采用了中国传统的青花瓷设计。\n\n三、成本计算\n\nGPT-4V API收费取决于图片的尺寸和参数detail（可选high和low），参考https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/calculating-costs\n\n众所周知，openai有他自己的货币，token，根据模型类型和美元强绑定\n\n这里模型是gpt-4-1106-vision-preview，input开销是0.01美刀每1k tokens，output是0.03美刀每1K tokens，和gpt-4-1106-preview的纯文本模型收费一致。\n\n具体怎么收费的呢？openai给了几个示例：\n\n1024 x 1024 square image in detail: high mode costs 765 tokens\n\n花费765tokens，这是怎么计算来的呢？openai做了解释：\n\n最大边1024小于2048,所以不做resize\n\n最小边为1024，所以做scale down到768*768\n\n最终需要4个512px的方块（512*512）来表示这个图像，花费 170*4 + 85 = 765\n\n2048 x 4096 image in detail: high mode costs 1105 tokens\n\n图片先缩放到1024 x 2048 以满足没有边大于2048\n\n最小边是1024 所以进一步缩放到 768 x 1536\n\n需要6个512px方块， 最终花费 170 * 6 + 85 = 1105.\n\n4096 x 8192 image in detail: low most costs 85 tokens\n\n不管多大，low quality模型的图片都是固定价格，也就是 85tokens\n\n总结一下high detail情况下的计算流程：\n\n第一步，最大边不能超2048像素，不然就给你缩放到2048\n\n第二步，将最小边缩放到768像素\n\n算有几个方块，根据方块数来收费，再加上85的固定价格\n\n四、模型结构揣测\n\n文档中还有一些语句有助于推断模型结构：\n\nFor high rest mode, the short side of the image should be less than 768px and the long side should be less than 2,000px.\n\n对于高分辨率模式，图像的短边应小于 768 像素，长边应小于 2,000 像素。\n\nlow will disable the “high res” model. The model will receive a low-res 512 x 512 version of the image, and represent the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that do not require high detail.\n\nlow将禁用“高分辨率”模型。该模型将收到图像的低分辨率 512 x 512 版本，并以 65 个代币的预算表示该图像。这使得 API 能够返回更快的响应，并在不需要高细节的用例中消耗更少的输入令牌。\n\nhigh will enable “high res” mode, which first allows the model to see the low res image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens.\n\nhigh 将启用“高分辨率”模式，该模式首先允许模型查看低分辨率图像，然后根据输入图像大小将输入图像创建为 512 像素正方形的详细裁剪。每个详细作物使用两倍的代币预算（65 个代币），总共 129 个代币。\n\n这个收费标准似乎有点前后矛盾，不过收费方式可以参考。\n\n首先是固定收费的85 tokens（或者是65 tokens），是因为一个表示整张图片的512px方块肯定会输入模型，不管你选哪个detail模式，这让模型有了整张图片的结构，而high detail进一步采取了分割图片为小块再输入模型的方式，让模型能看到图片的细节。\n\n分割图片的思想其实一直都有，从Google 2020年提出ViT开始便有，最近开源的大模型架构也多采用ViT\n\n比如LlaVA的架构（LlaVA仅支持一张图片输入）：\n\n其中Vision Encoder就采用ViT-L/14（来自CLIP论文 2021年），不出意外的话GPT-4V也是类似架构，但拥有多图输入能力，这就要提到多图能力较强的DeepSpeed Visual-Chat（没错是微软的，所以和openai的模型类似很正常）\n\nVisual-Chat架构（后面简称VC）：\n\n（但是因为截止目前没开源模型参数，只有训练代码和数据集，所以没法亲自测试）\n\nVC的突出特色就是支持多图对话，受限于上下文长度最多应该是8张，再通过改进的注意力机制MMCA，让文本token和图像token能产生奇妙的化学反应，达到更好的多图效果，这里的图片token是可以任意插入到文字token中的，我们不妨大胆猜测GPT-4V也是这种架构，那么模型decoder部分的输入可能就是这个样子（有理有据，令人信服）：\n\n| 文字tokens：\"System：你是一个友好的视觉对话助手。。。，这里是一张图片的整体图：\" | | 图片tokens：一个512px块代表整个图片 | | 文字tokens：\"这是图片左上角的局部图\"| | 图片tokens：一个512px块代表左上角 | | 文字tokens：\"这是图片右上角的局部图\"| | 图片tokens：一个512px块代表右上角 | | 文字tokens：\"这是图片左下角的局部图\"| | 图片tokens：一个512px块代表左下角 | | 文字tokens：\"这是图片右上角的局部图\"| | 图片tokens：一个512px块代表右下角 | | 文字tokens：\"\"User：请问图片里有什么?\",\"Robot:\"|\n\n这是笔者猜测的1024 x 1024图片的情况，具体decoder部分的实现openai肯定各种技巧拉满，那就不是笔者能猜测的了。\n\n根据成本，一个512px块消耗85tokens（这肯定把一些辅助的文字tokens也计算进去了），然后一张图整体消耗最多差不多1000tokens，如果能实际测一下网页版GPT4-V的对话历史可能就能根据最大长度限制128k tokens大致验证一下了（实际对话还存了很多用户看不见的东西，只能模糊测试一下）。\n\n2023.11.9 更新一下，有中科大大佬也在推测模型结构，大家可以在下面讨论：\n\nhttps://www.zhihu.com/question/626046049/answer/3280968661?utm_psn=1705925704049434624\n\n五、总结\n\ngpt4-vision这个api是唯一能识别出来是大闸蟹的（其他只是说是螃蟹），这就其实对人类有一些帮助了，能看出他背后的训练集比开源的模型要大很多（openai是懂大数据集的），这次发布会也把模型的知识更新到2023年四月了，可以说是图文对话开始真正对人类有帮助了,他自己的介绍页面也说了，gpt4-vision没有弱化gpt4的能力，而是在gpt4上加了vision这个功能。还有一点，gpt4-vision的速度快的离谱，这个回答6-7秒就完整返回了，而正常在单卡A100上小模型不做优化，返回这段文字大概需要15到20秒。\n\n原文链接：https://likegiver.com/archives/1699326331986，转载请注明原作者LikeGiver\n\n被Baseten收费方式震惊\n留学申请\n评论\n目录\n一、发布会总结\n二、图文对话测试\n2.1 LlaVA大闸蟹测试\n2.2 CogVLM大闸蟹测试\n2.3 GPT-4V API大闸蟹测试\n三、成本计算\n四、模型结构揣测\n五、总结\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs.

I read that in just one year, from 2018 to 2019, the number of computers, tablets and mobile phones using ad blockers increase from 142 million to 615 million.\n\nBrad: People can find out a lot about products from advertising. There's plenty of evidence that people usually begin the process of making a big purchase by looking at ads and reviews.\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhile I can see Karen's point that some people regard advertising useless and even distracting, I agree with Brad's perspective that advertising presents more valuable and significant information. (main argument) As mentioned by Brad, consumers can know a wide range of descriptions about product from advertising. (argument 1)\n\nAdvertisements give a detailed explanation about a product's outlook, features and instructions; however, such a wide range of information will not be approachable when people block advertisements.\n\nApart from what Bard has raised, I add that people can even have the access to negative reviews of advertising. (argument 2)\n\nDemerits of a product will be mentioned in the reviews of advertising, such as poor battery performance, slow delivery or high frequency maintenance, all of which help consumers arrive at informed decisions; On the contrary, well-considered decisions may not be reached without advertising.\n\nTherefore, advertising acts as an essential and indispensable source of information for potential buyers.(conclusion)\n\n综合写作例子\n\nThe reading passage contends that airships could become popular again because of their advantages over airplanes and helicopters. However, the listening material completely refutes the reading passage . It points out that airships are not likely to be used in the future. First, the reading passage believes that airships have the advantage of vertical life which can save fuel. In contrast, the listening passage holds that although airships can save fuel, they need special lifting gases such as hydrogen and helium, which will cause problems because hydrogen catches fire easily, which is the reason of many airships accidents in the past. Helium is safer but it’s difficult to obtain and expensive and it doesn’t provide as much lifting power as hydrogen. Second, the reading passage maintains that another advantage is that they can be used in hard-to-reach locations because of the ability to lift off and land vertically and they also have the ability to carry heavy loads. Nevertheless, the speaker in the listening says that using airships for picking up loads has its challenges. Airships should be very steady to pick up loads such as logs in the forest, but airships are large and light like balloons and difficult to keep steady in windy conditions. A strong wind can blow the airship and damage it. Third, the author, in the reading passage, thinks that airships can replace satellites because they can rise high and stay there without refueling for a long time. However, the lecturer argues that they can’t replace satellites because they can only rise to the height about 14 kilometers above the surface. On the other hand, there are very strong winds at that height, so airships have to spend a lot of fuel to resist those winds and stay in one place to do the telecommunications or surveying task. Then they will use up the fuel soon and need to refuel.\n\n深度学习入门资料分享\n笔者目前在干啥\n评论\n目录\n写作题型\nReturn 0;\n© 2023 LikeGiver's Blogs. All Rights Reserved. Powered by Halo.\n\nEnglish Website"
